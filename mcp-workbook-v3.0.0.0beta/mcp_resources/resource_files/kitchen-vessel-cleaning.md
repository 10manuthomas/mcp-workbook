## 1. Safety & Hygiene Fundamentals
*   **Temperature Safety:** Never submerge a hot pan in cold water; extreme temperature shifts can cause permanent warping.
*   **The "Sanitize" Step:** Washing removes visible dirt, but sanitizing kills bacteria. In 2026, it is recommended to rinse vessels in 75°C (167°F) water for 2 minutes or use a food-safe sanitizer.
*   **Air Drying:** Whenever possible, let vessels air dry. Towel drying can reintroduce bacteria if the towel is not perfectly clean.

## 2. Material-Specific Care

| Material | Daily Cleaning Method | Avoid This |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stainless Steel** | Warm soapy water with a soft sponge. Use a baking soda paste for burnt-on bits. | Steel wool, bleach, or ammonia (causes pitting/corrosion). |
| **Cast Iron** | Wash while warm with minimal soap. Dry immediately and apply a thin coat of oil. | Soaking overnight (causes rust) or using the dishwasher. |
| **Non-Stick** | Gentle hand washing with a soft sponge and liquid detergent. | Abrasive pads, metal utensils, and high-heat dishwasher cycles. |
| **Copper** | Use a specialized copper cleaner or a mix of lemon and salt to restore shine. | Leaving acidic foods inside for long periods; air drying (causes spots). |
| **Aluminum** | Hand wash with mild soap. Untreated aluminum is not dishwasher safe. | Dishwashers (causes rapid oxidation and darkening). |

## 3. Advanced Cleaning Hacks
*   **Rainbow Discoloration (Stainless):** Apply vinegar or lemon juice to remove heat tints and mineral deposits.
*   **Stubborn Stains:** Create a paste of baking soda and water. Let it sit for 15 minutes before scrubbing with a non-abrasive brush.
*   **Degreasing:** For sticky, greasy films on vessel exteriors, use a natural degreaser like [Simple Green](https://simplegreen.com) or a baking soda paste.
