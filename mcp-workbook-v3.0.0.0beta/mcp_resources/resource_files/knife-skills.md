## 1. The Anatomy of Knife Safety
Before making your first cut, establish a safe environment:
*   **Secure the Board:** Place a damp paper towel or a [non-slip silicone mat](https://www.seriouseats.com) under your cutting board to prevent sliding.
*   **The "Claw" Grip:** Always curl your fingertips inward on your stabilizing hand. Use your knuckles as a guide for the blade.
*   **The Pinch Grip:** Grip the base of the blade with your thumb and forefinger for maximum control; do not rest your index finger on the spine.
*   **Sharpness is Safety:** A dull blade requires more force, increasing the risk of a dangerous slip.

## 2. Essential Knife Types
While many sets come with dozens of pieces, you only truly need three:
1.  **Chef’s Knife (8-inch):** Your primary tool for 90% of kitchen tasks.
2.  **Paring Knife:** For intricate work like peeling, coring, or deveining shrimp.
3.  **Serrated Knife:** For bread, tomatoes, and citrus fruits.

## 3. Standard Culinary Cuts
Uniformity is key to ensuring all pieces of food cook at the same rate.

| Cut Name | Dimensions | Common Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Batonnet** | 1/4" x 1/4" x 2" | French fries, crudités |
| **Julienne** | 1/8" x 1/8" x 2" | Salads, stir-fries (matchsticks) |
| **Brunoise** | 1/8" Cubes | Garnishes, aromatics (from Julienne) |
| **Small Dice** | 1/4" Cubes | Sautéed vegetables, soups |
| **Medium Dice** | 1/2" Cubes | Stews, roasting |
| **Chiffonade** | Thin Ribbons | Leafy herbs (basil, mint) and kale |

## 4. Maintenance & Longevity
To keep your tools in peak condition in 2026:
*   **Honing:** Use a [Honing Steel](https://www.wusthof.com) every time you use your knife to realign the microscopic teeth of the blade.
*   **Cleaning:** **Hand wash only.** Dishwashers use high heat and abrasive detergents that dull blades and crack wooden handles.
*   **Storage:** Use a magnetic strip or blade guards. Avoid tossing knives loose in a drawer.

## 5. Learning Resources
For visual learners, you can find professional demonstrations via the [Culinary Institute of America (CIA)](https://www.ciachef.edu) or high-quality tutorials on [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com).
