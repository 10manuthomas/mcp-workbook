# Flight Layover Survival Guide

## ⏱️ Short Connection (The "Power Walk" Mode)
- [ ] **Check the Map:** Download the airport app or save a PDF map to find your next gate before you land.
- [ ] **Inform the Crew:** If your first flight is delayed, tell the flight attendants; they may be able to let you off the plane first.
- [ ] **Follow Signs:** Look for "Flight Connections" or "Transfer" signs immediately upon exiting the aircraft.
- [ ] **Sit Up Front:** When booking, choose a seat near the front of the plane to deboard faster.

## 🏨 Long Connection (The "Relaxation" Mode)
- [ ] **Lounge Access:** Check if your credit card provides Priority Pass or if you can buy a one-time entry for a shower and meal.
- [ ] **Stay Active:** Walk the full length of the terminal to improve circulation and prevent leg swelling.
- [ ] **Tech Prep:** Locate charging stations early or use your portable power bank.
- [ ] **Refresh:** Pack a "layover kit" in your carry-on with a toothbrush, deodorant, and a fresh shirt.

## 🌍 International Considerations
- [ ] **Transit Visas:** Verify if a visa is required for your nationality at the layover hub.
- [ ] **Customs:** Be aware that some countries require you to re-clear security even if you stay airside.
- [ ] **Currency:** Carry a small amount of local cash or ensures your credit card has no foreign transaction fees for snacks.

## 🎒 Carry-On Essentials
- [ ] Portable charger & universal adapter.
- [ ] Reusable water bottle (fill it *after* security).
- [ ] Downloaded movies/podcasts for offline use.
- [ ] Noise-canceling headphones to block airport chaos.
